<p>I have experience in several areas of development. Some of them include: HTML/CSS, JS, Solidity, Python, C++, and GMS2. And made several projects that use those skills, such as <a href="https://github.com/theortsac/frens-dao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FrensDAO</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stamp-gaming/stamp-contract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stamp</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/theortsac/discord-card-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord card game</a>,  <a href="https://github.com/theortsac/glass-kwi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glass Kiwi</a> (made in my first 48 hours game jam), and so much more that you can find on <a href="https://github.com/theortsac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my GitHub</a>. Some of my other social medias are: theortsac#0001 and <a href="https://twitter.com/ortsacthe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@OrtsacThe</a>.</p>

Hello, I am TheOrtsac, I live in Brazil and I am a <span id="k">professional developer</span>.
<p>I started programming in 2018, since then I've been on many paths, whether it's game development, python, solidity, or participation in computer olympiads. I'm always working to improve, and also to reinvent myself as a professional. Programming is my passion, which is why I chose this career path.</p>
<p><span id="a">“Why is my profession important?”</span><br />
    - I think it's because the people in the programming area can solve complicated problems and create amazing experiences with the slightest bit of imagination.<br />
    <span id="a">“What do I think about the programming industry?”</span><br />
    - I love the programming industry because it's such a welcoming space, and programming felt, for me, like a superpower, where I could create products that solved problems with only my time.<br />
    <span id="a">“How do I treat other professionals in my industry (and in general?)”</span><br />
    - As everyone in this world, I was born with no knowledge, and I depended on the people that supported me and my desire of learning to develop it, that's why I like to treat a starting programmer like I would have liked to be treated when I started. I apply this thought with anyone in my life.

    When I got my first cellphone, I baffled by that object that looked like magic in my eyes. Since then I fell in love with technology, but I was always interested in creating things, whatever it was. I started writing a book, and published in 2017. A short time later I became interested in the hacker world, and downloaded Kali Linux onto my computer, but in the end I couldn't do anything about it. After it I go into into the gaming world, I started with Java but it was really boring, so I went to GameMaker Studio 2, and there using the Game Maker Language, I took my first steps with programming. I continued and decided to breach my knowledge to other languages such as Python and C++. After entering the NFT world I started learning Solidity. I'm doing the Brazilian Informatics Olympiad, and this year I became the second place in my state and 55th in the whole country.
