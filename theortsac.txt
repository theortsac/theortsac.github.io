Hello, I am TheOrtsac, I live in Brazil and I am a <span id="k">professional developer</span>.
<p>I'm a developer who started programming in 2018, since then I've been on many paths, whether it's game development, python program creation, web development or participation in computer olympics. I'm always working to improve myself, and also to reinvent myself as a professional. Programming is my passion, which is why I chose this career path.</p>
<p><span id="a">“Why is my profession important?”</span><br/>
- I think it's because the people in the programming area can make the slightest bit of imagination into reality through the art of coding.<br/>
<span id="a">“What do I think about the programming industry?”</span><br/>
- The programming industry for me will be (if it's not already) the dominant industry in all spectrums of society, we can turn our knowledge into money, another reason that I focus on it.<br/>
<span id="a">“How do I treat other professionals in my industry (and in general?)”</span><br/>
- As everyone in this world, I was born with no knowledge, and I depended on the people that supported me and me desire of learning something to develop it, that's why I like to treat a starting programmer like I would like to be treated when I started. And when it comes to people with the same level of knowledge or above me, I always like to talk with them about what we are learning and what we are able to do, we are able to get lots of insights with it.

I got my first cell phone when I was 5 years old, I was baffled by that object that looked like magic in my eyes. Since then I fell in love with technology, but I was always interested in creating things, whatever it was. I started writing a book, and published this in 2017 at the age of 8 years old. A short time later I became interested in the hacker world, and I downloaded Kali Linux onto my computer, but in the end I couldn't do anything about it. So I went into the gaming world, I started with Java but it was really boring, so I went to GameMaker Studio 2, and there using the Game Maker Language, I took my first steps with programming. I continued until I got here, I'm doing the Brazilian Informatics Olympiad and I reached the national stage (when I receive more information I'll update you), at level 1 of the Olympiad for the first and second year of high school, I'm in the seventh of elementary school. My dreams are to get into MIT, and be a successful person with possibly a successful company.
